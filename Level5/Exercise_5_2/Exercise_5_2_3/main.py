'''
Create a decorator that memoizeâ€™s the result of a function. This decorator should be flexible enough that it can work with a function with any number of parameters.
Modify the Timer class to work as a decorator (feel free to use the provided sample code).
Per QUANTNET site, NO RELATION TO TIMER CLASS. PORT OVER CODE FROM CLASS, IN VERBATIM.

'It should be a function, separate from the class. The function should reside in the same .py file as the Timer class.'
For consistency, the memoize function was also placed in the Timer.py.
