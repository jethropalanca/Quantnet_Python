This file implements an ABS valuation model for two tranches in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Quantnet Python class.
It uses monte carlo simulation to generate fair rates for the tranches. Tranche payouts are calculated using loan and asset classes.
Functions within the project wrap things up together by running a program that calculates fair rates and provides meaningful
statistics related to the ABS.
