'''
Test Run of Project with Financial monte Carlo (runMonte). WITH Multi-processing.

Create a LoanPool object that consists of 1,500 loans. Use the provided CSV file of loan data to create these Loan objects.

Instantiate your StructuredSecurities object, specify the total notional (from the LoanPool), add two
standard tranches (class A and class B in terms of subordination), and specify sequential or pro-rata mode.
The rates for each tranche can be arbitrary (for now). Note that subordinated tranches should always
have a higher rate, as they have increased risk.

Call doWaterfall and save the results into two CSV files (one for the asset side and one for the liabilities
side). All the tranchesâ€™ data for a given time period should be a single row in the CSV. The reserve
account balance should also be in liabilities CSV, for each time period. Each time period gets its own
row. Note that you may need to do some clever list comprehensions and string parsing to get this to
output correctly.
